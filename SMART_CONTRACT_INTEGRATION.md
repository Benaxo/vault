# Smart Contract Integration Summary

## Contract Address Update

- **New Contract Address**: `0x3f98E523EBac7B8c2cb1Fe02fCa1600Fb17fEC9a`
- **Previous**: Address-based vault system
- **Current**: Goal-based system with unique goalId per savings goal

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Contract Functions

- **Replaced**: `setGoal()` → `createGoal(goalAmount, unlockTimestamp, description)`
- **Updated**: `deposit()` now requires `(tokenAddress, goalId)` parameters
- **Updated**: `withdraw(goalId)` and `withdrawEarly(goalId, amount)` use goalId
- **New Reading Functions**:
  - `getUserGoals(address)` → returns array of goalIds for user
  - `getGoalBasics(goalId)` → returns balance, goal, unlock time, owner, active status
  - `getGoalDescription(goalId)` → returns goal description
  - `isGoalReached(goalId)` → checks if goal amount is reached

### 2. Component Updates

#### DepositForm.jsx

- Modified to require goal selection before deposits
- Updated contract call to use `goalId` parameter
- Enhanced validation to ensure goal has `blockchainGoalId`

#### GoalSelector.jsx

- Added blockchain integration for goal creation
- Automatic `createGoal` contract call when goals are created in Firebase
- Event parsing to extract goalId from transaction receipts
- Links Firebase goals with blockchain goals via `blockchainGoalId`

#### VaultProgress.jsx

- Complete rewrite to use goal-based system
- Loads user goals from Firebase and matches with blockchain data
- Uses `getGoalBasics()` and `getGoalDescription()` for real-time data
- Added goal selection for users with multiple goals

#### WithdrawForm.jsx

- Updated to support goal-based withdrawals
- Added goal selection interface for users with multiple goals
- Uses `goalId` for both regular and early withdrawals
- Enhanced validation for withdrawal conditions

#### GoalSetting.jsx

- Updated to use `createGoal()` instead of `setGoal()`
- Automatic blockchain integration when goals are created
- Event parsing for goalId extraction

### 3. New Utilities

#### contractUtils.js

- `extractGoalIdFromLogs()` - Parses transaction logs to extract goalId
- `parseContractEvent()` - Generic event parsing utility
- `formatEth()`, `ethToWei()` - ETH/Wei conversion utilities
- `formatTimestamp()` - Date formatting for timestamps

### 4. Firebase Integration Enhancements

- Added `blockchainGoalId` field to goals collection
- Enhanced `updateGoal()` service for linking blockchain data
- Improved goal filtering to show only goals with blockchain integration

### 5. User Experience Improvements

- **Goal Selection**: Users can now manage multiple savings goals
- **Real-time Data**: Goal progress is fetched directly from blockchain
- **Seamless Integration**: Firebase goals automatically created on blockchain
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for integration failures
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during blockchain operations

## Configuration Files Updated

- `src/constants.js` - Contract address updated
- `src/abi/PiggyBankVault.json` - New ABI with goal-based functions

## Key Features

✅ Multi-goal support per user
✅ Automatic blockchain-Firebase synchronization  
✅ Real-time balance tracking from blockchain
✅ Goal-specific deposits and withdrawals
✅ Event-based goalId extraction
✅ Backward compatibility for existing users
✅ Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test goal creation with wallet connection
2. Verify deposit functionality with goalId selection
3. Test withdrawal with multiple goals
4. Validate event parsing accuracy
5. Check Firebase-blockchain data consistency

## Future Enhancements

- Implement proper event decoding with contract interface
- Add goal completion celebrations
- Enable goal modification (amount, date)
- Add goal analytics and statistics
- Implement goal sharing features
